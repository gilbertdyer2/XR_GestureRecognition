## (WIP) XR_GestureRecognition 
XR gesture recognition tool for Unity, built as a final project for a neural nets course. Work in progress, uses Siamese neural network to identify motion gestures (series of xyz coordinates of an XR controller over time), preventing the need for any specialized training of gestures and allowing for the creation of new gestures on-the-fly.
